# ✂️ VisionCut

A minimalist, privacy-first image suite powered by client-side AI. VisionCut allows users to perform professional-grade background removal and photo adjustments without ever uploading data to a server.

## ✨ Features
* **AI Background Removal:** Edge-computed semantic segmentation via neural networks. It doesn't just look for colors; it understands objects.
* **Pixel-Perfect Baking:** Adjustments (Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Temperature) are rendered directly into the pixel buffer, ensuring your export looks exactly like your preview.
* **Precision Cropping:** Responsive UI with aspect-ratio locking for 16:9, 1:1, and 9:16 formats, optimized for social media and web standards.
* **Synchronous Export Pipeline:** A reinforced canvas logic that prevents "corrupted file" errors by validating image dimensions before every download.
* **Vignette Engine:** A custom mathematical radial gradient overlay that adds professional depth to any photo.
